When metrics dip below 92%, it auto-triggers a quantum-prompt re-simulation in QDI: encode audit data into qubit rotations → evolve fixed reservoir (e.g., 4–8 qubit superposition + entanglement) → measure expectations → feed classical readout back into DSPy teleprompter for targeted nudge (BootstrapFewshot or MIPROv2). Dependabot lattice propagates any resulting dep/Qiskit updates.",
